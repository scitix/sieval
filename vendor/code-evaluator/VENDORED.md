# Vendored: code-evaluator

- Upstream: <https://github.com/scitix/code-evaluator>
- Vendored at commit: `e4802268f2b491c7ea3d7ed7704dd8582bc079be`
  (previously a git submodule at `submodules/code-evaluator`)

## Local patches on top of that commit

- `app/exec_py_test.py` — clearer checker messages + opt-in float tolerance
  (`CODE_EVAL_FLOAT_TOL`); from fork branch `fix/checker-messages-float-tol`
  (`cfc47d8`), plus a docstring note on `_value_close`'s type-based tolerance.
- `app/server.py`, `README.md`, `requirements/scicode.txt`,
  `docker/Dockerfile.scicode` — SciCode support: `source="scicode"` direct-run
  alias, scientific-stack pins, and a Python 3.11 image.
- `app/exec_py_test.py`, `app/server.py`, `README.md` — test-case progress
  counts. `execute_test` additionally returns how many cases passed, and the
  response `data` gains `n_cases` / `n_passed`. Execution behaviour is
  unchanged: the case loop still stops at the first failure, and because cases
  run in order the failing index *is* the passed count, so the count costs
  nothing. `None` means unknown (subprocess killed on timeout), not zero. Needed
  by sieval's LiveCodeBench task, which records per-rollout grading detail rather
  than a bare pass/fail; the task tolerates both fields being absent, so an
  unpatched evaluator still works. Not yet upstream — land in
  `scitix/code-evaluator` and re-vendor.
